I'm **Nicholas Armstrong**, a software leader in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I
moved to Waterloo in 2004 to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and
followed that up with a Master's of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My thesis proposed a
technique for speeding up web browsing over mobile networks through a proxy server that
scans server responses and pushes content to the user just-in-time.

Since 2009, I have held leadership roles at <a title="Carnegie Technologies" href="http://www.pravala.com">Carnegie
Technologies</a> and <a title="Pravala Networks" href="http://www.pravala.com">Pravala Networks</a>, where I built the
technical team, established the engineering culture, supervised and mentored developers, organized development activities,
wrote code, architected systems, authored patents and technical sales material, and work directly with our customers around the globe.

Undergraduate Computer Engineering at Waterloo is a Co-operative Education degree program, which meant that I switched every
four months between school and working for a company in my field. Over the course of six work terms I worked for four companies,
culminating in two terms on the Windows Presentation Foundation team at Microsoft. While at Microsoft, I designed and developed
<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/PhotoSuru/">photoSuru</a>, a WPF photo viewing sample
application presented in the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/KYN02/">PDC 2008 Keynote</a>.

My development interests include cloud services, mobile & web apps, networks, user experience, and
web application performance. Over the course of my career I have worked extensively with node.js, Docker,
Android, React, and Power BI, and have experience in numerous other languages, platforms, tools, and environments.
