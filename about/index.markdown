I'm **Nicholas Armstrong**, a software program manager and developer living and working in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I
moved to Waterloo in 2004 to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and
followed that up with a Master's of Applied Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering, also at the University of
Waterloo. My thesis proposed a technique for speeding up web browsing over mobile networks through a proxy server that
scans server responses and pushes content to the user just-in-time. Since 2009, I have held a leadership role at <a
title="Pravala Inc." href="http://www.pravala.com">Pravala</a>, a startup focused on improving multi-network experiences
on mobile devices through Wi-Fi offload, bandwidth aggregation, quality monitoring, and network policy. At Pravala, I
organize development activities, write code, architect web infrastructure, develop technical sales material, evaluate
market positioning, and work directly with our customers around the globe.

Undergraduate Computer Engineering at Waterloo is a Co-operative Education degree program, which meant that, starting at
the end of my first undergraduate year, I switched every four months between school and working for a company in my
field. My first co-op position was at Hydro One Networks in Barrie, Ontario; the second, which I completed in April
2006, was at the Greater Toronto Airports Authority in Mississauga. I spent two terms with Systemgroup, Inc. between
September 2006 and September 2008 as a software consultant, working out of their Mississauga office as well as various
client sites around the Greater Toronto Area. I spent my last two work terms (between January 2008 and December 2008) on
the Windows Presentation Foundation team at Microsoft, once as a Software Design Engineer (SDE) Intern and once as a
Program Manager Intern. During those terms at Microsoft, I designed and developed <a
href="http://www.photosuru.com/">photoSuru</a>, a WPF photo viewing developer sample application that has garnered <a

href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/PhotoSuru/">fame</a>.

My development interests include user experience, interface design, and high performance web applications and web
services. My recent work has focused on delivering high-performance web services to drive mobile client and web
applications at scale, and single-page web applications built on top of those services. Over the course of my career I
have worked extensively with Node.js, Android, WPF, SQL, and .NET, with experience in numerous other languages,
platforms, tools, and environments.
