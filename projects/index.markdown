A (short) collection of the personal projects I have worked on throughout the years.  More work can be
found in the [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/) and [Blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/) sections.

            My most extensive personal project to date has been my Masters Thesis.  My thesis proposed a technique for
            speeding up web browsing over mobile networks through a proxy server that scans server responses and pushes
            content to the user just-in-time, and involved the construction of a Node.js proxy and Google Chrome browser
            extension for measurement.  All of the intricate details are in

        <p>
            During my time as a Masters student at the University of Waterloo, I had the opportunity to TA for
            <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wdbishop/">Bill Bishop</a> in the Fall 2009 edition of ECE 150.
            During my time as a TA, I put together a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/teaching/ece150/">few examples</a>
            of the concepts taught in the course.

        <p>
            Unsurprisingly, you learn quite a number of things in Engineering that you'd never expect to learn. What is
            surprising is the variety and peculiarity of things that you do actually get taught. After a lengthy
            conversation about the things we had "learned", I threw together a
            <a href="{% post_url 2007-09-26-things-you-learn-in-engineering %}">page of items</a> in the (then) style
            of the UW first year information package so that prospective students might get a complete idea of all the
            things they might learn at UW.

            UW Computer Engineers will all remember the Coldfire boards, the lovely hardware units that we got to write
            an operating system for. To commemorate the - ahem, entire week - of my life that I lost thanks to the
            experience, I designed a <a href="{% post_url 2007-09-23-coldfire-the-computer-engineering-experience%}">

        <p>
            When I was just starting out with WPF, I wanted to get a bit more experience with WPF Animation, and so I
            took a Saturday morning to build a neat little move-style title animator. It animates a series of "titles",
            a position/name string, on to a black screen at a configurable interval; more details, and a link to the
            source, are on the <a href="{% post_url 2007-09-27-wpf-title-animator %}">WPF Title Animator page</a>.
