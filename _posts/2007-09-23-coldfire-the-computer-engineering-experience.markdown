         Motorola Coldfire boards for our operating systems course.

After wasting what seemed like an eternity and actually ended up being 100+ hours in a dingy lab over the course of one
week (and without missing classes, I might add), my group and I finished most of an operating system. It worked pretty
well, though it was prone to crashes and didn't particularly like writing out to the secondary console, but ran all of
the automated and manual tests.

To commemorate the experience, I fiddled around with Adobe Illustrator for a bit and developed a desktop background, a
thumbnail of which is presented on the left. We talked about making T-shirts, but the delivery time at the end of last
term was too long. If you're still interested in getting a shirt, leave a comment and we'll see if we have enough for a
batch of shirts!
